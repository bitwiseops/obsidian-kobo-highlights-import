# Obsidian Kobo Highlight Importer

This plugin aims to make highlight import from Kobo devices easier.

_At the time of writing, it has only been tested with a Kobo Libra 2 with few book highlights._

## How to use

Once installed, the steps to import your highlights directly into the vault are:

1. Connect your Kobo device to PC using a proper USB cable
2. Check if it has mounted automatically, or mount it manually (e.g. open the root folder of your Kobo using a file manager)
3. Open the import window using the plugin button
4. Locate _KoboReader.sqlite_ in the _.kobo_ folder ( this folder is hidden, so if you don't see it you should enable hidden files view from system configs )
5. Extract
